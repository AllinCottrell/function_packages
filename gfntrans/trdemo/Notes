Something along the lines of translations.xml could be folded into
a gfn file, either by including a stand-alone XML file referenced
in the spec file, or with the help of a GUI translations editor
module.

When a package is loaded into memory, we could check for the
presence of translations, and if we find any then process them
using libxml and store an xmlDocPtr attached to the fnpkg struct.
This would enable a considerably streamlined built-in version of
the prototype hansl function T_().
