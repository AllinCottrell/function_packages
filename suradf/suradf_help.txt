This package implements the unit root test defined by Jan Boucher
Breuer, Robert McNown and Myles Wallace ("Series-specific Unit Root
Tests with Panel Data", Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics,
64:5, 2002, pp. 527-546).

The test gives a specific result for the unit-root null hypothesis for
each series in a given list, exploiting the cross-correlations of the
series to gain greater power than a regular univariate ADF test,
provided that the correlations which are exploited via SUR
estimation are fairly substantial.

The test statistic, labeled SURADF, follows a non-standard
distribution; this package will calculate critical values and p-values
via the Monte Carlo method with a chosen number of replications.

Parameters of the suradf() function:

xlist: The list of (at least two) series to be tested.

plags: Row vector containing lag orders for the series.  You may give
  a specific lag length for each series, or may supply a 1-vector in
  which case the same order is used for all.

t1: The 1-based index of the observation at which estimation should
  start. This should make allowance for observations lost by forming
  lags.

drift: Use 1 to allow for drift in the series or 0 to enforce an
  intercept of zero in the null hypothesis.

nr: The number of Monte Carlo replications. If this is set to zero
  SURADF test statistics are calculated but no critical values are
  reported. A value of 1000 should be sufficient to get meaningful
  critical values, but use a higher value if you like.
