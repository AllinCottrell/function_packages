The addlist() function takes the following arguments.

Required arguments

y:      dependent variable
list0:  list of regressors to be included unconditionally
list1:  list of candidate regressors for addition

Optional (integer) arguments

criterion: 1 = AIC (default), 2 = BIC, 3 = HQC, 4 = CVC
estimator: 1 = OLS (default), 2 = fixed effects, 3 = random effects
verbose:   0 for quiet, 1 (default) for summary output, 2 for
           detailed output

The available selection criteria:

AIC: Akaike Information Criterion
BIC: Bayesian Information Criterion (Schwarz)
HQC: Hannan-Quinn Criterion
CVC: Cross-Validation Criterion

Note that for all four criteria, smaller values are better. For
details see the chapter titled "Model selection criteria" in the
Gretl User's Guide and, for cross-validation, the help for the
"leverage" command.

Algorithm:

1. Regress y on list0 using the selected estimator, then scan list1
   for the variable that, if added, improves the estimates according
   to the selected criterion to the greatest extent.

2. If improvement is possible, add the new regressor to list0 and
   remove it from list1, and go to step 1; if not, stop.

Returns the final list of regressors. By default prints some
information about the variable selection process and also prints
the "best" model on completion (if it differs from the original
specification), but this can be suppressed by setting setting
"verbose" to 0.

Changes in version 2.0:

- Add Hannan-Quinn and Cross-validation to the set of criteria
- Add option to control verbosity
- Add option to use a panel-data estimator
- Update hansl idioms
